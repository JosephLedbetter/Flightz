<h3> About </h3> 
<p> Flightz is an informational assistant when individuals are looking for places to travel. The main factor behind this application is to inform the interested party with local news, weather, and flight information for the desired destination. When reviewing their travels they will be btter informed of potential local conflicts, incliment weather, etc. When dealing with numerous travel agencies you are given more information about hotels, transportation, etc. but it is our belief that there are more intangible decisions that go into the decision of where to travel.

<p>Additionally we did implement firebase real time database connection to record the most frequently searched destinations. The purose is to collect relevant information pertaining to frequent travelrs and desired destinations to assist third party travel agencies and their ability to see key metrics to maximize revenues during certain travel periods from different areas such as Asia, European Union, North America, etc.</p>
